                <p class="unique-desc-block-text">Milk chocolate is a solid chocolate confectionery containing cocoa,
                    sugar and milk. It is the most
                    consumed type of chocolate. Chocolate was originally sold and consumed as a beverage in
                    pre-Columbian times. Although four-fifths of all milk chocolate is sold in the United States and
                    Europe, increasingly large amounts are consumed in China and Latin America.</p>

                    It is the primary source of nutrition for young mammals (including breastfed human infants) before
                    they are able to digest solid food.Early-lactation milk, which is called colostrum, contains
                    antibodies that strengthen the immune system, and thus reduces the risk of many diseases. Milk
                    contains many nutrients, including protein and lactose.</p>

                    the best ways to gain an understanding of this type of chocolate is to compare it to a different
                    type of chocolate. Semisweet is darker than milk chocolate. In a taste comparison, it has a slightly
                    bitter taste whereas milk chocolate is sweeter and more mellow. This delectable flavor of chocolate
                    is very versatile.</p>
